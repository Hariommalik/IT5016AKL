Summary

The ParkingLot class is a straightforward system created to manage a parking lot, using very simple OOP features in Python. One can park a vehicle, take out the parked vehicle and also see the present use of the parking space. The system has records on the parked cars using their number plates and provides availability depending on the number of parking space available.

Operating System for the Parking Lot

Overview

This is a simple python based application for making the work of parking lots easy. It allows people to park vehicles, take out the vehicles and there is current status of Put vehicles.

Features

Park a Car: Parks a car in the parking lot and requires a plate license for the car parked.

Remove a Car: A reverse feature providing all so possible needs it is to remove a car Out from the parking lot by providing a plate license.

Display Parking Lot: Presumably, display all the cars under decoration

Capacity Management: The application serves to ensure that the user does not bypass staircase postulate for parking area although minimizes risks.

Installation

Make sure that you have Python installed on your computer (version 3.x is preferable).

Following that Clone this repository or download the script.

bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

bash

python parking_lot.py

Go through the prompts to use the parking lot system.

Example

Set the parking lot desired number of vehicles.

Select choices to set, take out or present vehicles.

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle

1. Planning

Specify: Parking lot management system requirements

Detect the user need, like parking, takeout cars or show reaming leave space.

2. Analysis

Analyze function user requirements

Remember to add edge cases such as dealing with the parking lots are full and how you plan on handling duplicates.

3. Design

You are free to design the class structure, focus on ParkingLot God Class.

Diagram different parking, removal and car display methodologies.

4. Implementation

Code the ParkingLot Class and its methods.

Low-level: Create a front-end for user interaction.

5. Testing

Test the application for:

Correctly parking cars.

Taking away what cars exist and with cases when they do not.

Correctly presenting the list of parked cars.

Capacity control of parking lot

6. Deployment

Release the Execution of the App for Users Access. It is a macOS — only app, but it runs on your local machine.

7. Maintenance

Change the App according to audience feedback

You might want to add additional features — e.g. with parking time charges etc.

Conclusion

This document specifies the architecture of ParkingLot management system specifying how it works, its usage and development life cycle. Feel free to tweak and enhance this for your own purposes.
